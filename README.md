# Filter_Based_Feature_Selection

Filter-based feature selection approaches in machine learning are methods that evaluate the relevance of features based on their statistical properties, without involving any machine learning model. Some common filter-based feature selection methods include:

1. Chi-Square Test: This method evaluates the independence between each feature and the target 
   variable by calculating the chi-square statistic.

2. Information Gain: This method measures the reduction in entropy or increase in information 
   provided by a feature with respect to the target variable.

3. Correlation Coefficient: This method measures the linear relationship between two variables and 
  can be used to evaluate the relevance of features.

4. Variance Threshold: This method filters out features with low variance, assuming that features 
   with low variance are less informative.

5. Mutual Information: This method measures the amount of information that can be obtained about 
   one variable through another variable.

These filter-based methods are computationally efficient and can be used as a preprocessing step to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset before applying more complex feature selection or machine learning algorithms.
